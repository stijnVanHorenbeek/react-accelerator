# Chapter 1: JSX

## Adding javascript inside jsx

### Using an object property

add a class Greeter to the app component file. Normally this should go in another file, but this is only temporary:

```ts
class Greeter {
  constructor(public greeting: string, public title: string) {}
}

const greeting = new Greeter("hey", "React");
```

Adding it to the h1 tag is as easy as this: `{greeting.greeting} {greeting.title}`

### using a function

Delete the class and the greeter variable and write a function that returns a string.

for example:

```ts
const getGreeting = (title: string) => `Hello ${title}`;
```

add the function call to the h1 tag

## JSX gets compiled to javascript

In the App component add a label and an input field in html. The input field has a class too.

```html
<label for="search">Search</label>
<input class="text-input" id="search" type="text" />
```

The for and the class are red underlined and when you save you should get these 2 errors:

Property 'for' does not exist on type 'DetailedHTMLProps<LabelHTMLAttributes<HTMLLabelElement>, HTMLLabelElement>'. Did you mean 'htmlFor'?",

Type '{ class: string; id: string; type: "text"; }' is not assignable to type 'DetailedHTMLProps<InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>, HTMLInputElement>'.
Property 'class' does not exist on type 'DetailedHTMLProps<InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>, HTMLInputElement>'. Did you mean 'className'?

Why would that be necessary? Also not that in jsx these names are using camelcase.

Change the 2 attributes to the correct names.

Add this css to the index.css to check whether the input element got the correct class

```css
.text-input {
  border-color: red;
  margin-left: 1em;
}
```

## showing lists

copy/paste this list in the `app.tsx` file

```ts
class TechBook {
  constructor(
    public title: string,
    public url: string,
    public author: string,
    public num_comments: number,
    public points: number,
    public id: number
  ) {}
}

const books: Array<TechBook> = new Array<TechBook>();
books.push(
  new TechBook("React", "https://reactjs.org", "Jordan Walke", 3, 4, 0)
);
books.push(
  new TechBook(
    "Redux",
    "https://redux.js.org",
    "Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark",
    2,
    5,
    1
  )
);
```

now add this code below the search field

```html
<hr />
<ul></ul>
```

without looking lower, add a function between the ul-tags that makes a li tag for each book, containing only the title.

 An example solution could be:
  
  ```jsx
<ul>
  {books.map((book) => (
    <li>{book.title}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
  ```
  
</details>

This does compile, but what do you see in the console of your browser's dev tools?

Luckily our book objects have an id. Add this to your function.

<details>

 An example solution could be:
  
  ```jsx
<ul>
  {books.map((book) => (
    <li key={book.id}>{book.title}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
  ```
  
</details>

Complete the function in the li so it has this form

```html
<li key>
  <span><a><!--link to book url, text is title --></span>
  <span><!-- author --></span>
  <span><!-- number of comments --></span>
  <span><!-- points --></span>
</li>

```

      </span>
      <span>{book.author}</span>
      <span>{book.num_comments}</span>
      <span>{book.points}</span>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

</details>

# clean up

- clear everything in the index.css file
- delete the greeter function and class if you still have those.
- change the title in the h1 to 'hacker stories'
